Azure Virtual Machine Disk Encryption by Harshad Shah


- Disk encryption is a technology which protects information by converting it into unreadable code that cannot be deciphered easily by unauthorized people. Disk encryption uses disk encryption software or hardware to encrypt every bit of data that goes on a disk or disk volume.


- Azure Disk encryption can be applied to both Linux and Windows virtual machines, as well as to virtual machine scale sets.
